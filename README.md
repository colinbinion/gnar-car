## About GnarCar

Sick of driving up to the mountains alone? Sick of not being able to take advantage of the snow because you don't have a ride up to the mountains? GnarCar is a ride sharing app that allows users to share or join rides heading up the mountains.

Drivers - Choose a ski mountain, a time and place to meet up, and offer a ride to those in need at your own price point.

Riders - Whether you don't have a car or your ride can't take you up to the mountains safely, select from a variety of ride offerings.
